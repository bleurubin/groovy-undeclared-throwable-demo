# Don't be careless with Groovy (un)checked exceptions

Groovy language introduced many interesting features from Java programmer point of view. One of them is lack of differentiation between checked and unchecked exceptions - a nice quality for programmers who struggled with checked exceptions requirements. It turns out however that using this neat Groovy feature with existing frameworks can sometimes be insidious which I experienced lately.

I was working with relatively straightforward microservice written in Groovy. It was built on top of Spring Boot 1.3.. Among others it used `@RestController` to define REST endpoints and `@ControllerAdvice` to handle exceptions thrown by controller or its internals.
Very simplified example code looks like this (complete source code can be downloaded from https://github.com/yu55/groovy-undeclared-throwable-demo ):

```groovy
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController

@RestController
class ExampleRestController {

    @RequestMapping(value = '/get')
    String get() {
        /*
         Lets imagine this exception is thrown somewhere from deepest layers of our service code
         and we don't have to be immediately aware of this.
          */
        throw new ExampleRestControllerException()
    }
}
```
```groovy
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody

@ControllerAdvice
class ExampleRestControllerAdvice {

    @ExceptionHandler(value = ExampleRestControllerException.class)
    @ResponseBody
    String onExampleRestControllerException() {
        return 'ExampleRestControllerException handled in ControllerAdvice'
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(value = Exception.class)
    @ResponseBody
    String onException() {
        return 'Exception handled in ControllerAdvice'
    }
}
```
```groovy
class ExampleRestControllerException extends Exception {
}
```

When `ExampleRestControllerException` was thrown it was handled by `onExampleRestControllerException()` method in `ExampleRestControllerAdvice` class. And this worked perfectly fine.
But I had to add simple aspect after returning of `get` method in `ExampleRestController` to do some additional stuff.
```groovy
@Aspect
@Component
class RestControllerAspect {

    @AfterReturning('execution(* org.yu55.ued.controller.ExampleRestController.get())')
    public void logServiceAccess(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        // empty implementation for clarity reasons
    }
```

With this simple aspect introduced microservice began behaving strangely. `ExampleRestControllerAdvice` started calling `onException()` method instead of `onExampleRestControllerException()` when `ExampleRestControllerException` was thrown. I wasn't expecting that. What happend?
When aspect for `ExampleRestController.get()` method is defined Spring generates a proxy for `ExampleRestController`. Since `ExampleRestController` doesn't implement any interface Spring uses CGLIB library instead of `java.lang.reflect.Proxy` for proxy dynamic generation [[1](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.4.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html#aop-proxying)]. Generated proxy class name is similar to `ExampleRestController$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$8d751c8@4481` and it's `ExampleRestController` subclass which intercepts all methods calls. There is also another dynamically generated class created: `ExampleRestController$$FastClassBySpringCGLIB$$b01891ea` which is a `ExampleRestController` class wrapper. This wrapper class promises faster methods invocations than the Java reflection API [[2](https://dzone.com/articles/cglib-missing-manual)]. Spring is invoking `get` method (via `sun.reflect` reflection classes) on enhancer class which then invokes `get` method (via CGLIB `MethodProxy`) on fast class instance. When controllers `get` method throws `ExampleRestControllerException` it's rethrown by fast class to enhancer class and then enhancer class `get` method throws `java.lang.reflect.UndeclaredThrowableException` (which contains `ExampleRestControllerException` inside). This results `ExampleRestControllerAdvice` matching `UndeclaredThrowableException` with `Exception` class and firing handler method different than expected. Why `UndeclaredThrowableException` is thrown? Because written in Groovy `get` method indeed didn't declared any checked exceptions that it could potentially throw. Proxy doesn't know anything about that controller is written in Groovy and no throws declared doesn't mean that no checked exception may occur. This behaviour also corresponds to `Proxy` documentation [[3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html)].
This issue can be fixed easily by adding checked exceptions to `get` method definition or defining `ExampleRestControllerException` as runtime exception. Former solution technically works but isn't 'groovy' though and the latter is an approach that Spring prefers and is currently considered to be best practice for exception handling [[4](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2012/03/why-should-you-use-unchecked-exceptions.html)].

At the end I would not blame Groovy for this situation. Instead I would rather point that despite Groovy simply doesn't care about checked exceptions doesn't mean that other libraries also doesn't care. This is not what most of programmers think at first place when using Groovy. Best thing we can do to defend against situations like this is to carefully prepare tests. Imagine no controller tests for `ExampleRestControllerException` case - whole application builds and runs perfectly on production until this special case occurs and controller simply returns wrong answer to client. Bug like this may be not so obvious and fast to track and fix.
